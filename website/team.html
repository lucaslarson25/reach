              Team REACH works collaboratively through a structured approach to 
              project management and communication. The team meets weekly with 
              their mentor every Thursday from 4:30–5:30 PM and attends 
              bi-weekly sponsor meetings every other Tuesday from 2:00–3:30 PM. 
              In addition, weekly capstone lectures take place on Fridays from 
              12:45–3:15 PM. Impromptu meetings may also be scheduled with at 
              least 24-hour notice if urgent issues arise.
              <br>
              <br>
              Communication and coordination are facilitated through a shared 
              task tracker, GitHub issues, and a version-controlled repository. 
              Team members provide quick status updates at the start of 
              meetings, review ongoing tasks, and discuss blockers before 
              assigning new action items. Meeting agendas and reminders are 
              prepared in advance by the team lead, and comprehensive minutes 
              are recorded and distributed within 24 hours to ensure alignment 
              and accountability. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Decisions are made by consensus whenever possible, or by a ¾ 
              majority vote if consensus cannot be reached. In cases of 
              persistent disagreement, issues are escalated to the faculty
              mentor for resolution.
              <br>
              <br>
              The team emphasizes professional, respectful communication, 
              maintaining accountability, and adhering to established document 
              and coding standards (Google Docs, Microsoft Word/PowerPoint, 
              Draw.io, Lucidchart, GitHub branching conventions).
