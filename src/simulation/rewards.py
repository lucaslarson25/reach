Reward Functions for Different Tasks
=====================================

This module defines reward functions for various tasks the robotic arm
should learn (reaching, grasping, lifting, etc.).

Each reward function should:
- Encourage task completion
- Promote smooth, natural movements
- Penalize excessive energy consumption
- Consider safety constraints
- Be shaped to enable learning (not too sparse)

Common reward components:
- Distance to target (reaching tasks)
- Grasp stability (manipulation tasks)
- Trajectory smoothness
- Energy efficiency
- Collision avoidance
