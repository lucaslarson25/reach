"""
Reaching Task Environment
=========================

A simple reaching task where the robotic arm must move its end-effector
to a target position in 3D space.

This is typically the first task to implement, as it's simpler than
manipulation and helps validate the basic environment setup.

Task details:
- Target position is randomized at each episode reset
- Success when end-effector is within threshold distance of target
- Reward based on distance reduction and smoothness
- Episode terminates on success or timeout
