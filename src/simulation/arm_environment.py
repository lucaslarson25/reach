"""
Robotic Arm Gymnasium Environment
==================================

This file defines the main Gymnasium environment for the robotic arm simulation.
It wraps MuJoCo physics simulation and provides the RL interface.

Key responsibilities:
- Initialize MuJoCo model from XML
- Define observation space (joint angles, velocities, sensor data)
- Define action space (joint torques or position targets)
- Implement step() function for physics updates
- Implement reset() function for episode initialization
- Calculate rewards based on task objectives
- Handle rendering for visualization

The environment should be compatible with Stable-Baselines3 and other
RL libraries that use the Gymnasium interface.
