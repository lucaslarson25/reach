Simulation Module
=================

This module contains all MuJoCo-based simulation environments for the
robotic arm and task scenarios.

Key components:
- arm_environment.py: Main Gymnasium environment for the robotic arm
- tasks/: Individual task environments (reaching, grasping, etc.)
- models/: MuJoCo XML model definitions
- sensors.py: Sensor simulation and data processing
- rewards.py: Reward function definitions for different tasks
