Neural Network Policies
========================

Defines policy network architectures for RL agents.

These are used by PPO/SAC agents and define how observations
are mapped to actions.

Policy types:
- MLP Policy: Fully connected network (for state-based control)
- CNN Policy: Convolutional network (for vision-based control)
- Recurrent Policy: LSTM/GRU (for tasks requiring memory)

Each policy should output action distributions (for continuous control).
