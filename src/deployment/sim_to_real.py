Sim-to-Real Transfer
====================

Techniques for transferring policies trained in simulation to real hardware.

The "Reality Gap" Challenge:
- Simulation is never perfect
- Real world has friction, delays, noise that sim doesn't capture
- Policies that work perfectly in sim may fail on real hardware

Solutions implemented here:
- Domain Randomization: Randomize simulation parameters during training
- Domain Adaptation: Fine-tune policy with real-world data
- Observation Filtering: Add noise to sim to match real sensor noise
- Action Smoothing: Reduce jerkiness that works in sim but not reality
- Conservative Policies: Limit actions to safer subset

Key principle: Make simulation MORE realistic, not perfect.
Train robust policies that work despite reality gap.
