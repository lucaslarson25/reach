"""
Reinforcement Learning Agents
==============================

This module contains RL agent implementations for training the robotic arm.

Planned agents:
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) - primary algorithm
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) - alternative for continuous control
- Custom wrappers for Stable-Baselines3
- Policy networks and value networks
- Agent evaluation utilities

The agents should:
- Be compatible with our custom Gymnasium environments
- Support training on Monsoon HPC cluster
- Allow checkpointing and resuming
- Provide logging/metrics for TensorBoard

# from .sac_agent import SACAgent
# from .base_agent import BaseAgent
