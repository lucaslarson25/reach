"""
Database Interface
==================

Handles storage and retrieval of experimental data.

Purpose:
- Store all experiment configurations and results
- Enable comparison across different runs
- Track hyperparameter performance
- Save trajectories for analysis

Database Schema (Example):

experiments
-----------
- id (primary key)
- name (experiment name)
- config (YAML config as JSON)
- start_time
- end_time
- total_timesteps
- status (running, completed, failed)

episodes
--------
- id (primary key)
- experiment_id (foreign key)
- episode_number
- total_reward
- steps
- success (boolean)
- timestamp

checkpoints
-----------
- id (primary key)
- experiment_id (foreign key)
- timestep
- model_path
- metrics (JSON: mean_reward, success_rate, etc.)
- timestamp
