## Enhanced Existing Files

### 1. **requirements.txt** (Greatly Enhanced)
**Before:** Simple list with minimal comments
**After:** Detailed explanations for each package including:
- What the package does (in simple terms)
- Why we need it for the project
- Example use cases
- Links to documentation
- Analogies for complex concepts

**Example Enhancement:**
```python
# Before:
# numpy>=1.24.0  # Numerical operations

# After:
# numpy>=1.24.0  # Arrays, matrices, mathematical operations
#                # Example: storing joint angles as arrays [0.5, 1.2, -0.3]
```

---

### 2. **config/default.yaml** (Extensively Commented)
**Before:** Brief one-line comments
**After:** Multi-line explanations for each hyperparameter including:
- What the parameter controls
- How it affects learning
- Typical values to try
- Consequences of setting too high/low
- Why default value was chosen

**Example Enhancement:**
```yaml
# Before:
learning_rate: 0.0003  # Learning rate

# After:
learning_rate: 0.0003  # How big of steps to take when learning
                      # Too high: unstable, learns wrong things
                      # Too low: learns very slowly
                      # Good starting values: 0.0003, 0.0001, 0.001
```
